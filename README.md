# Spaghetti
The programming language that uses `goto` extensively.

The basic idea is to thwart the biggest programming pragma:

> "Never use `goto`."

As the name suggests, Spaghetti is a language that uses `goto` extensively, resulting in spaghetti code.

**NOTE:** This language is made for fun and educational purposes (building a compiler-interpreter). DO NOT use for any serious project.

This repository consists of the NodeJS interpreter for Spaghetti.
